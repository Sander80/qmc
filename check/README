HOW TO RUN THE TESTS
====================

Each test can be run by executing 'make <dirname>'. 
'make runtests' can be invoked to run all tests.
'make runselected' runs a selection of tests.
'make summarize' gives a one-line summary for each example:

make runtests:
   This command runs 'make test' for all subdirectories.

make summarize:
   By running "make summarize" the user obtains a printout of the status
   of all integrals for which 'make test' has been run earlier.
   Note that this command does not run any test.

make clean, make very-clean:
   Delete all generated files; i.e. run 'make very-clean'
   in every test directory.

make <dirname>:
   Run 'make test' in the directory <dirname>.


FUTHER OPTIONS
==============

Make's "-j<jmake>" option controls how many recipes make executes in parallel. 

In order to change the c++ compiler, you can set the environment variables CXX. 
For example, to run an with the clang++ compiler type
'CXX=clang++ make <example>'.
